PLEASE READ!!!
You're probably wondering what is going on here. It's cool. I get it.

If you do want a regular style.css file to pop up, uncomment the following line in your gulpfile.js file, in the style task.
.pipe(gulp.dest('./'))

The source versions of css, images and js reside in the 'assets/' folder, within their respective folder names '/css, /js, /images' etc...

Admittedly I'm still trying to figure this part out, but place your un-minified assets in the assets directories. The gulp default task
will take your files, do some crazy shit to them, such as minifying, renaming and moving to the assets folder, again, under
their respective folder names.

In functions.php notice that we're enqueing the main style (the minified version) and that we're also enqueing
production-min.js. Production-min file has all the relevant scripts for our project, combined into one minified file. Again
the idea here is for smaller file sizes, and fewer resource calls.

Changes you make to this theme should be happening to files in your 'src' directory. For now, I'm going to comment
the gulpfile.js file as much as possible and leave things in for you to go back and use yourself at another time, should
you wish to experiment.

As always, tips and pull requests welcome.
